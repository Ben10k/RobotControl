Remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes.
The early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by John Ericsson (pneumatic), John Louis Lay (electric wire guided),
and Victor von Scheliha (electric wire guided).
The Brennan torpedo, invented by Louis Brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra-rotating propellers that were spun by rapidly pulling
out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo. Differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be
guided to its target, making it "the world's first practical guided missile".
