Many robots were constructed before the dawn of computer-controlled servomechanisms, for the public relations purposes of major firms.
These were essentially machines that could perform a few stunts, like the automata of the 18th century. In 1928, one of the first humanoid robots was
exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Model Engineers Society in London. Invented by W. H. Richards, the robot - named Eric - consisted of
an aluminium suit of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a 12-volt power source. The robot could move its hands and head and
could be controlled by remote control or voice control.
