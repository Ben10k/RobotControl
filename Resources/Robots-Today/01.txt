Life-saving roach robots

Velociroach, the four-inch long cardboard-bodied roach might just be able to save your life during an emergency situation.
Velociroach can run so fast that it can cover a distance of 27 times its own body length in a second.
This tiny robot features a rigid but flexible exoskeleton that enables it to scurry into places that are impossible for humans to reach.
Much like real cockroaches, this robot can dart quickly into almost any tiny space and find people trapped in catastrophic situations.
