Window cleaning robots 

Tackling life's trickier chores and reaching those hard-to-reach spots, the ECOVACS Winbot 7 Series is a window cleaning robot that allows you sit back and
relax while it does the hard work. The robot uses a suction mechanism to stay on the glass while cleaning the insides and outsides of windows.
The robot depends on two modules to move around glass windows, as it sprays a cleaning solution into microfibre pads to clean.
